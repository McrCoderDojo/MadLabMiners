Outline Plan
------------

Let's get everyone on a server to build a winter wonderland.

  * Snow 
  * Massive Christmas Tree
  * Flashing lights
  * Decorations
  * Motion detection Santa
  * Reindeer
  * Elves
  * Snowball fights
  * ...

To Do List
----------

  1. Archive whatever is already running on the server -- Dave's working on this one
  2. Update latest packages on the server
  3. Set up a git folder that will build a docker file for the server
  4. Make a base world with snow
  5. Make sure whitelisting with sensible defaults are working on the server
  6. Write up instructions how to get the game pack and how to get on the server
  7. Make sure the game pack is up-to-date and working with the server build
  8. Figure out how to take snapshots of the world from the server periodically in case of need to rollback
  9. Can we make a motion detector turn on lights?
  10. Can we make a Santa that chats with you?
  11. Snowball fights?
  12. Reindeer?  Elves?

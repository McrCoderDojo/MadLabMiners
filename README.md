===========================

Outline Plan
------------

Keeping going on the [Nand to Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) theme, this time we're going to be seeing different ways that we can build machines to add up two numbers.

1. String, clothes pegs, and paper
2. Minetest with people being the gates
3. Minetest with Mescon gates


Binary Numbers
--------------

In order to add up numbers on a computer you have first got to represent numbers as "on" and "off" values in binary:

Half-Adder
-----------

You can add up two binary numbers with a half-adder:
